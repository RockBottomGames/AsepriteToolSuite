## Welcome!
Hey! This is Taylor from Rock Bottom Games L.L.C. and I a solo developer am working on games. Currently, I have been working on getting faster at making games for game jams. I also have been making tools more than half my life, so when I feel like I need a tool, I make one. I decided I will make my tools available for free to anyone who wants them. I have plans for multiple tools in Aseprite, the first one being Quick Auto Tile.  When I have more than one project I will probably separate them on itch so you can download individually or all at once. Currently it is all under [Rock Bottom Games Aseprite Tool Suite.](https://rockbottomgames.itch.io/rbg-aseprite-tool-suite)

## [Quick Auto Tile](QuickAutoTile/README.md)

Quick Auto Tile is the first tool under the RBGATS umbrella. I made it with the intention of speeding up my workflow.  I like to make the full autotile template for my tilesets in Godot, but a lot of the time it's a lot of copy pasting, and ensuring all the different pieces line up got annoying. So I reviewed all the tiles and noticed if you split the tiles in fourths you could reuse a lot of the drawing for a good base to build off of.

Below is a gif of how much less I need to draw to get the full Godot Auto Tile template filled out. If you allow the tilesets in Aseprite to flip X, Y, or D it will mirror the tiles on the x, y, or diagonal axes, and that can further decrease the required drawing.
